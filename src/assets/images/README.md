# Images Folder

Place your logo file here.

**Supported formats:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.svg`, `.webp`

**Recommended filename:** `logo.png` (or `logo.svg`, `logo.jpg`, etc.)

The logo should be:
- Square or circular format works best
- Recommended size: 120x120px or larger (will be scaled down)
- Transparent background recommended for PNG/SVG

Once you upload your logo file, it will automatically appear in the sidebar. If the file is not found, a placeholder will be shown instead.
